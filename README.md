# FAQ 
## Why create another collection of language-learning resources online?
Almost every online collection of language-learning resources is poorly maintained, and a lot of resources are behind paywalls. It seemed a good idea to make this collection more of a community effort and that Github would be ideal for such an effort. Also, existing repos, like [this one](https://github.com/melling/LanguageLearning) were in desperate need of a make over.

The other main aim was to compile vocab / word frequency lists in one place. No more searching around for vocab.

## [Flags are not languages](http://www.flagsarenotlanguages.com/blog/why-flags-do-not-represent-language/)
Yes, but colorful flags are eye candy & github clickbait is a thing. Sorry to anyone this offends.

## You missed language XYZ
This list is anything but exhaustive, so feel free to file a PR.


## What if I want to pay?
Open an issue, and we can reconsider the "only free resoruces" stance.
