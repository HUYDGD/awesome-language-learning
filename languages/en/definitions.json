This distinction between purpose and desire is central to Mill\u2019s conception of the will. When we develop purposes we can will against mere likings or aversions: \u2018In the case of an habitual purpose, instead of willing the thing because we desire it, we often desire it only because we will it\u2019 . Every action is caused by a motive, but not every motive is a liking or aversion: When the will is said to be determined by motives, a motive does not mean always, or solely, the anticipation of a pleasure or of a pain\u2026. A habit of willing is commonly called a purpose; and among the causes of our volitions, and of the actions which flow from them, must be reckoned not only likings and aversions, but also purposes.  The formation of purposes from desires is the evolution of will; it is also the development of character.
