# English

Currently, this directory contains a list of ~700 common English words (as determined by word frequency).
This document was built starting with [the Fluent Forever 625 word list](https://blog.fluent-forever.com/appendix5/).

The aim is to expand this list to include the 1000 most common words, so it can serve as a starting point for translations into word lists for other languages. We'll also include more semantic content (like part of speech, and audio recording link) to make it easier to quickly create flash cards.

Right now, this list is alphabetical, not ordered by frequency. It's also slightly arbitrary. Parts of it are based on a word frequency list, but other parts are guessed by github copilot (so only indirectly from a word frequency list).
