The modern infinitive was probably back-formed in late Old Dutch from the first-person plural subjunctive s\u012bn (\u201cwe be\u201d), since this form had become identical to the infinitive in other verbs during the late Old Dutch period. Compare also German sein, Low German sien.\nThe original infinitive survives in wezen, from Middle Dutch wesen, from Old Dutch wesan, from Proto-Germanic *wesan\u0105, from *h\u2082wes- (\u201cto reside\u201d).
