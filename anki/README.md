# Anki tools

- [ ] This eventually needs to be moved into its own repo.

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is extremely powerful. Unfortunately, (1) it can take a lot of time to learn, & (2) it can take a lot of time to create high-quality notes.

You can use other people's decks, but these are often low-quality (e.g., they rely on translation and omit pictures), and they are not personalized to you.

Instead of giving up Anki for a less-powerful solution or resorting to other people's decks, let's create a little plugin that makes it easier to create high-quality anki cards.

This is a spiritual successor to [anki-squared](https://github.com/jqhoogland/anki-squared).

# Usage

Right now, this is usable from the command-line. Eventually, I might turn it into a plugin that actually runs inside Anki.
