# Word Frequency Lists

Word's obey [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law). The most common words are much more common than the least common.

In practice, this means that you only need "around 2000" words to understand most everyday speech. So it makes sense to begin with the most common words (rather than obscure fruits & vegetables).

The aim of the list in this directory is to be a modified set of words, likely to be highly common across languages. It serves as a starting for learning vocabulary.

It still needs work: this list is alphabetical (i.e., not ordered by frequency), and it's somewhat arbitrary. Parts of it are based on a word frequency list, but other parts are filled in by github copilot (so only indirectly from a word frequency list).
